Using "gameBoardy.json" I used XMLHttpRequest to get the information from the 
file. 

The "gameBoardy.json" file can be modified by changing the status of the 
"isBomb" to "b" (bomb) or "e" (empty). This will reflect in the shuffledboard 
variable as isBomb is pushed into the array.

The div with the id set to "parsedData" displays the parsed data.

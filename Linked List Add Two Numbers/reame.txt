The Program is implemented to concatonate all numbers of a given linked list and concatonate
another linked list seperately with the addTwoNumbers() function. The sum is then found between 
the lists. The sum is returned as a new linked list with each digit being an element in the 
list. The e# and p# in Main() can be modified to test the inputed lists.
